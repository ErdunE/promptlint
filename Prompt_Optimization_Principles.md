# Prompt Optimization Principles (Foundational Document)

**Version:** Draft v1.2  
**Document Type:** Core Design Philosophy & Immutable Guidelines  
**Scope:** All PromptLint optimization behaviors across all features and versions  
**Authority Level:** Foundational - No modifications without explicit stakeholder approval  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-02

## Preamble: Purpose & Scope

These principles define the **absolute behavioral boundaries** of PromptLint's optimization engine across all architecture levels. They serve as:

1. **Design Constraints:** What the system CAN and CANNOT do
2. **Quality Gates:** How to evaluate optimization success  
3. **Decision Framework:** How to resolve implementation ambiguities
4. **User Promise:** What users can expect from every optimization

**Critical Note:** These principles override all other considerations including user requests, technical convenience, or perceived improvements that violate these constraints.
**Architecture Context:** These principles apply uniformly across all engine sophistication levels defined in Product_Vision_and_Architecture.md:
- **Level 1 (Template Engine):** Rule-based structural transformation with manual templates
- **Level 2 (Pattern Recognition):** Intelligent classification with dynamic optimization
- **Level 3 (Domain Specialist):** Expert-level optimization with domain knowledge
- **Level 4 (Contextual Intelligence):** Project-aware, personalized optimization

**Immutable Constraint:** Regardless of technical sophistication level, faithfulness and user intent preservation remain absolute requirements.

## 1. Faithfulness Principle (PRIMARY CONSTRAINT - ALL LEVELS)

### 1.1 Core Definition
**The optimized prompt must preserve 100% of the user's original intent, scope, and technical requirements across all engine sophistication levels.**

### 1.2 Level-Specific Applications
**Level 1 (Current MVP) - Template Engine:**

- Apply structural templates without content addition
- Use keyword recognition for professional terminology mapping
- Surface missing information through explicit placeholders

**Level 2-4 (Future) - Advanced Engines:**

- Advanced pattern recognition must not infer unstated requirements
- Domain expertise cannot add technical specifications beyond user input
- Contextual intelligence cannot assume project context or user background
- Personalization cannot modify core user intent or expand scope

### 1.3 Allowed Transformations (Universal Across Levels)
- **Linguistic:** Synonyms, professional terminology, grammatical corrections
- **Structural:** Reorganization into lists, bullet points, standardized formats
- **Clarity:** Explicit statement of implicit requirements already present in user input
- **Professionalism:** Casual → formal language transformation

### 1.4 Forbidden Transformations (Absolute Prohibitions - All Levels)
- **❌ Technical Additions:** Adding programming languages, frameworks, versions, environments not specified by user
- **❌ Requirement Expansion:** Adding constraints, features, or specifications beyond user input  
- **❌ Context Assumptions:** Inferring user skill level, project context, or intended use case
- **❌ Scope Changes:** Expanding or narrowing the requested task boundaries
- **❌ Format Assumptions:** Specifying data formats, input types, or output structures not mentioned by user

Note: Advanced engine capabilities (Level 2-4) may provide more sophisticated structural organization and professional language enhancement, but the prohibition against content addition remains absolute.

### 1.5 Ambiguity Handling Protocol
When user intent is unclear or information is missing:
- **✅ CORRECT:** Surface the ambiguity explicitly and prompt user for clarification
- **❌ INCORRECT:** Make assumptions or provide "reasonable defaults"

**Example Implementation:**
```
User Input: "write a sorting function"
✅ Correct Optimization:
Task: Implement sorting function
Requirements: [Please specify: programming language, input data type, sorting algorithm preference]

❌ Incorrect Optimization:  
Task: Implement quicksort function in Python
Input: List of integers
Output: Sorted list of integers
```

---

## 2. Professional Enhancement Principle

### 2.1 Language Transformation Standards
Transform casual expressions into professional, technical language while maintaining exact semantic meaning:

| Casual → Professional |
|----------------------|
| "write" → "Implement" / "Create" / "Develop" |
| "make it work" → "Ensure functionality" |
| "fix this" → "Debug and resolve" |  
| "something like" → "Algorithm similar to" (with clarification needed) |
| "just do X" → "Task: X" |

### 2.2 Tone Standardization
- **Target Tone:** Clear, direct, professionally instructional
- **Avoided Tones:** Casual, uncertain, conversational, apologetic
- **Maintained Elements:** User's technical specificity level and domain knowledge indicators

### 2.3 Professional Structure Requirements
Every optimization should attempt to include:
1. **Explicit Task Statement:** Clear action verb + specific objective
2. **Input Specification:** When provided by user or clearly implied
3. **Output Specification:** When provided by user or clearly implied  
4. **Constraint Identification:** When limitations are mentioned by user

---

## 3. Structure-First Principle

### 3.1 Format Hierarchy (Preference Order)
1. **Structured Lists** (Highest Priority)
   ```
   Task: [Clear objective]
   Input: [Format if specified]
   Output: [Expected result if specified]
   Constraints: [Limitations if mentioned]
   ```

2. **Bullet Points** 
   ```
   - Implement [specific algorithm/function]
   - Handle [input type] data
   - Return [output format]
   ```

3. **Numbered Lists** (For sequential processes)
   ```
   1. Parse input data
   2. Apply transformation logic  
   3. Return formatted output
   ```

4. **Structured Prose** (Lowest Priority - avoid when possible)

### 3.2 Structure Selection Logic
- **Simple Tasks:** Use basic Task/Input/Output format
- **Complex Tasks:** Use comprehensive structured breakdown
- **Sequential Tasks:** Use numbered lists for step-by-step processes
- **Multi-requirement Tasks:** Use bullet points for parallel requirements

### 3.3 Template Consistency
Maintain consistent terminology across all optimizations:
- "Task:" not "Objective:" or "Goal:"
- "Input:" not "Parameters:" or "Arguments:"  
- "Output:" not "Returns:" or "Result:"
- "Constraints:" not "Requirements:" or "Limitations:"

---

## 4. Conciseness Principle

### 4.1 Brevity Requirements
- **Mandate:** Optimized version must be more concise than original
- **Method:** Eliminate redundancy, filler words, unnecessary qualifiers
- **Constraint:** Conciseness cannot reduce clarity or completeness

### 4.2 Redundancy Elimination
Remove or consolidate:
- Repeated concepts or requirements
- Unnecessary hedging language ("perhaps", "maybe", "possibly")
- Verbose explanations that can be expressed directly
- Multiple ways of stating the same requirement

### 4.3 Precision Enhancement
Replace vague terms with precise alternatives:
- "good performance" → "optimized for [specific metric]" (only if user specified the metric)
- "handle errors" → "implement error handling" 
- "make it robust" → "include input validation" (only if clearly implied by context)

---

## 5. Actionability Principle

### 5.1 Clear Action Requirements
Every optimized prompt must contain:
- **Explicit Action Verb:** What the AI should do (implement, debug, explain, analyze)
- **Specific Target:** What should be acted upon (algorithm, function, system)
- **Measurable Outcome:** How success is determined (working code, explanation, analysis)

### 5.2 Implementation Clarity
- **Avoid Ambiguous Instructions:** "Make it better", "Fix the issues", "Improve performance"
- **Prefer Specific Actions:** "Implement error handling", "Optimize for memory usage", "Debug the authentication logic"
- **Include Success Criteria:** When provided by user or clearly implied by context

### 5.3 Scope Boundaries
- **Define Task Limits:** What is and isn't included in the request
- **Clarify Deliverables:** Code only, code + tests, explanation, documentation, etc.
- **Specify Assumptions:** Only those explicitly stated or necessarily implied by user input

---

## 6. User Clarification Principle

### 6.1 Missing Information Protocol
When critical information is absent, the optimization must:
1. **Acknowledge the gap explicitly** in the optimized prompt
2. **Request specific clarification** from the user  
3. **Provide context** for why the information is needed
4. **Offer examples** of acceptable clarifications

### 6.2 Clarification Request Format
```
Task: [Clearly stated objective based on user input]
Missing Information Required:
- [Specific item 1] (Example: programming language - Python, Java, C++, etc.)
- [Specific item 2] (Example: input data format - array, list, CSV file, etc.)  
- [Additional items as needed]

Once clarified, the implementation can proceed with [brief description of what will be delivered].
```

### 6.3 Assumption Avoidance
**Never assume:**
- Programming language preferences
- Development environment or platform  
- Data formats or structures not explicitly mentioned
- Performance requirements not stated
- Testing or documentation expectations
- User expertise level or background

**Always surface ambiguity rather than resolve it through assumptions.**

## 7. Quality Validation Framework

### 7.1 Optimization Success Criteria
A successful optimization must satisfy ALL of the following:

1. **Faithfulness Test:** Original intent completely preserved ✓
2. **Structure Test:** Uses preferred structured format ✓  
3. **Conciseness Test:** Shorter and clearer than original ✓
4. **Actionability Test:** Contains specific, measurable instructions ✓
5. **Professionalism Test:** Uses appropriate technical language ✓
6. **Completeness Test:** No missing elements from original prompt ✓

### 7.2 Failure Conditions (Rejection Criteria)
Reject any optimization that:
- Adds technical details not provided by user
- Changes the scope or complexity of the request
- Makes assumptions about user context or preferences
- Reduces clarity in favor of brevity
- Uses inconsistent formatting or terminology

### 7.3 Edge Case Handling
**Minimal Input:** For very brief prompts (1-3 words), focus on structure and clarification requests rather than extensive expansion.

**Overly Detailed Input:** For comprehensive prompts, focus on structure and organization rather than content addition.

**Technical Jargon:** Preserve user's technical terminology exactly - don't simplify or expand unless clearly beneficial for clarity.

---

## 8. Implementation Guidelines

### 8.1 Multi-Candidate Generation
When generating multiple rephrase candidates:
- **Maintain Semantic Identity:** All candidates must preserve identical meaning
- **Vary Structure:** Use different organizational approaches (list vs. prose vs. bullet points)
- **Consistent Quality:** All candidates must meet the same quality standards  
- **User Choice:** Let user select preferred structural approach

### 8.2 Context Preservation
- **Technical Level:** Match user's apparent expertise level in language complexity
- **Domain Language:** Preserve domain-specific terminology exactly as used
- **Style Preferences:** Maintain any consistent style indicators from user input

### 8.3 Error Recovery
When optimization fails or produces low-quality results:
- **Fallback:** Return minimally structured version of original
- **Transparency:** Inform user that optimization was limited
- **User Control:** Always allow reversion to original input

---

## 9. Boundary Examples & Anti-Patterns

### 9.1 Correct Optimization Examples

**Example 1 - Minimal Enhancement:**
```
Input: "write a function to sort numbers"
Output: 
Task: Implement number sorting function
Requirements: [Please specify programming language and input format]
```

**Example 2 - Structure Without Addition:**
```
Input: "debug my login code, it's not working with OAuth"  
Output:
Task: Debug OAuth login implementation
Issue: Authentication not functioning properly
Requirements: [Please provide code and specific error details]
```

### 9.2 Forbidden Anti-Patterns

**Anti-Pattern 1 - Technical Addition:**
```
Input: "create a web server"
❌ Wrong Output:
Task: Create Express.js web server in Node.js
Features: REST API endpoints, middleware support, error handling
Deployment: Docker containerization ready
```

**Anti-Pattern 2 - Scope Expansion:**
```  
Input: "fix the bug in my code"
❌ Wrong Output:
Task: Debug, fix, test, and document code issue
Requirements: Comprehensive error analysis with unit tests
```

**Anti-Pattern 3 - Assumption Making:**
```
Input: "make a calculator"
❌ Wrong Output:  
Task: Create scientific calculator web application
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Features: Basic operations, advanced functions, history
```

## 10. Compliance & Verification

### 10.1 Automated Compliance Checking
Every optimization must pass automated verification for:
- No technical additions beyond user input
- Consistent terminology usage  
- Structural format compliance
- Conciseness improvement measurement

### 10.2 Manual Quality Review
Periodic manual review should verify:
- Intent preservation accuracy
- Professional tone appropriateness
- User clarification effectiveness  
- Overall user experience quality

### 10.3 User Feedback Integration
- Track user selections among rephrase candidates
- Monitor user reversion rates to original prompts
- Collect explicit feedback on optimization quality
