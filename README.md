# PromptLint

**PromptLint = Grammarly + ESLint for Prompts**

PromptLint is a developer-focused tool that helps transform casual or vague prompts into **clearer, more structured, and more professional instructions**.  

Unlike other tools, PromptLint does **not** invent or guess missing details. Instead, it focuses on **rephrasing and structuring** the user’s input so that AI systems can better understand and execute.
