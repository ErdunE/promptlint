- **Purpose:** Simplified Level 4 contextual intelligence for Chrome extension
- **Implementation:** Lightweight analysis engine with pattern-based detection
- **Performance:** Sub-millisecond processing for real-time analysis
- **Features:**
  - Intent detection (create, explain, analyze, code)
  - Communication style analysis (conversational, direct, technical)
  - Project complexity assessment (low, medium, high, enterprise)
  - Collaboration level detection (individual, team, organization)

#### **2. Enhanced FloatingPanel** (`src/content-script/floating-panel.ts`)
- **Purpose:** Display Level 4 contextual insights in the PromptLint panel
- **Integration:** Seamless Level 4 analysis with existing lint results
- **UI Components:**
  - 🧠 Contextual Intelligence section
  - Confidence indicators with color coding
  - Real-time optimization suggestions
  - Processing time metrics

### **Level 4 Analysis Pipeline:**

```
User Prompt → Level4IntegrationService → FloatingPanel Display
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓
Pattern Analysis → Contextual Insights → Visual Feedback
     ↓                    ↓                        ↓
Intent Detection → Optimization Suggestions → User Enhancement
```
