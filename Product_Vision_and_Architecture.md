## Executive Summary

PromptLint represents a fundamental shift in how humans communicate with AI systems. Rather than relying on trial-and-error or expert knowledge, PromptLint provides systematic, scalable tools for transforming human intent into AI-optimal instructions.

**Core Thesis:** The quality of AI interactions is primarily limited by communication clarity, not AI capability. PromptLint removes this bottleneck through intelligent prompt optimization.
